# Dossier
To revolutionise the technical recruitment system by proposing a more data driven approach and bridge the gap between the hiring professionals and candidates. 

Dossier, a web application that acquires and analyses the candidate’s contribution on professional platforms like GitHub, LeetCode and HackerRank. 

The system highlights the candidates’ strengths, interests and  experience with programming languages, tools and frameworks. A neat and concise visual summary of their technical knowledge is presented for the hiring companies. 

* Dossier provides candidates/students and recruiters logins authenticated by Auth0.

* Candidates provide their technical platforms usernames during login. Which is later used to fetch information on the candidate using API calls. This information later is filtered and rendered in the form of visual graphs and charts for the candidate to view. 
* Recruiters can view all the candidates portfolios and contact them if candidates skills are of their interest
* Filtering algorithm filters candidates based on the skills/languages the recruiters search for.
